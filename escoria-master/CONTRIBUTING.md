Contributing guidelines
=======================

Escoria is a free/libre and open source point-and-click framework for the MIT licensed game engine [Godot](http://godotengine.org/). If you're reading this document, that hopefully means you want to help us make the framework even better.

Contributions can take many forms. Whether you want to help write code, suggest new features or report bugs, your contributions are welcome, and together we can make Escoria the best it can be.

Making a Pull Request
---------------------

If you want to write a new feature for Escoria or help us fix a bug, the first thing you should do is to fork this project. From there you typically create a new branch to work on, make some commits, and when you're happy with the result, you push the changes to your repository on GitHub and create a pull request.

When introducing new features, keep in mind that Escoria was built to support many different kinds of interfaces, so as a general rule, new features should not alter Escoria's default behavior. Instead, aim to write features that can be toggled in the project settings or instanced into existing nodes.

Since we're a small team with no dedicated project manager, we prefer significant, thematic commits, and will work with you to get your code in great shape before merging it. If you want help with any part of the process, don't hesitate to contact us through the channels listed in the contact section below.

Submitting an issue
----------------

When submitting an issue, the most important thing is to be clear, and provide any details we might need to understand your issue. E.g., if you're writing a bug report, make sure to include the platform you're using or exporting your game to, if relevant. If you've experienced multiple bugs, make sure to create separate issues for each, unless issues discussing the problems already exists. This makes it easier for us to track issues, and gives us actionable tasks to work on.

In addition to bugs, issues are also the best tool for us to discuss potential new features in Escoria, and any and all suggestions are welcome, though we can not make any promises. When suggesting features, providing examples of games with said features is helpful, as it makes it easier for us to consider whether or not we think they would be good fits for the framework.

Contact
-------

The easiest way to reach us for an informal chat or advice is through the #escoria IRC channel on Freenode. If you don't have a dedicated IRC client, Freenode has a [web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/), and there's also a Matrix bridge at #freenode_#escoria:matrix.org.
